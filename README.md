Last tested 18/12/24 

# RETROSPECTIVE
- I spent a lot of time thinking about the layout and design, which changed a lot as I made this
- The project spec asked for individual checkboxes with their own "priority" and "duedate", but that wasn't intuitive to me at all. Instead I wanted big tasks broken down into a lot of smaller steps, which is how I use my own "todo lists" in my everyday life.

# NEW SKILLS ACQUIRED
- JSON data
- saving and loading data to and from the browser

# SELF CRITIQUE
- The final js codebase is messier than I'd like. Having to handle things between the front end user input and the backend data is tricky.
- My code would be a lot cleaner if I had a way to listen for and trigger custom events, but I'm not sure how to do that in js
- I used `"contenteditable="true"` fields for everything in this project. This was a mistake, as honestly, these fields are a MASSIVE pain. Using regular input fields seems like it would've been way nicer.

# SUPERFLUOUS EXTRAS I'D LIKE TO DO IN FUTURE
- drag and drop functionality
