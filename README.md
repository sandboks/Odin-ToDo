# RETROSPECTIVE
- The final js codebase is messier than I'd like. Having to handle things between the front end user input and the backend data is tricky.
- My code would be a lot cleaner if I had a way to listen for and trigger custom events, but I'm not sure how to do that in js
- I spent a lot of time thinking about the layout and design, which changed a lot as I made this
- The project spec asked for individual checkboxes with their own "priority" and "duedate", but that wasn't intuitive to me at all. Instead I wanted big tasks broken down into a lot of smaller steps, which is how I use my own "todo lists" in my everyday life.

# NEW SKILLS ACQUIRED
- JSON data
- saving and loading data to and from the browser

# SELF CRITIQUE
- the .css file is massive (1000+ lines). In future, I need to find ways to organize it better and make it more manageable
- similarly, the main script.js file could be split into smaller pieces, to reflect the way the code is already divided into different controller "objects" that manage different parts of the logic

# SUPERFLUOUS EXTRAS I'D LIKE TO DO IN FUTURE
- add variable CPU difficulty
- add an intro screen
- add a 2nd screen where you choose the number of rounds to play?
- update the HUD to include number of rounds won
- dark mode
